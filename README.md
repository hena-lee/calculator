# Simple Calculator
Through motiQ Research's Calculator tutorial on YouTube, I learned how to create a simple calculator that performs basic math operations, such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. 
I also learned the practicality of using a table to create the container for the calculator and learned how to use the grids as buttons.
I also got to observe how seamlessly JavaScript works with HTML tags to perform basic functions. 
This project helped me visualize how code works and was a very fun project overall!
